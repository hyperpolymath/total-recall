Legend: ✓ = Complete | ◐ = In Progress | ○ = Not Started

== Phase 1: Specification

Once the project specification is uploaded:

* [ ] Define project purpose and scope
* [ ] Identify core modules and components
* [ ] Select primary implementation language(s) from allowed stack
* [ ] Create STATE.scm with phase tracking
* [ ] Define initial API/interface contracts
* [ ] Set up package definitions (guix.scm and/or flake.nix)
* [ ] Configure .well-known files (security.txt, ai.txt, humans.txt)
* [ ] Populate RSR_COMPLIANCE.adoc

== Phase 2: Core Implementation

* [ ] Scaffold project structure
* [ ] Implement core functionality
* [ ] Unit test suite
* [ ] Integration tests
* [ ] Documentation (API docs, user guide)

== Phase 3: Hardening

* [ ] Security audit
* [ ] Performance optimization
* [ ] Accessibility review
* [ ] SBOM generation
* [ ] Container builds (Wolfi-based)

== Phase 4: Release

* [ ] Version 1.0.0
* [ ] Published packages
* [ ] Deployment documentation
* [ ] Community announcement

== Future Considerations

_To be determined based on project specification._
