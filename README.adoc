| Phase | Specification pending
| Code | None yet
| Docs | Infrastructure templates only

This repository has been initialised with the https://github.com/hyperpolymath/RSR-template-repo[RSR (Rhodium Standard Repository)] template infrastructure but awaits project specification and implementation.

== What's Here Now

The following infrastructure is in place:

=== Build & Automation
* `justfile` — RSR-standard task runner with ~50 recipes for build, test, lint, docs, containers, security, and validation
* `.editorconfig` — Consistent editor settings
* `.gitattributes` / `.gitignore` — Git configuration

=== CI/CD Workflows
* CodeQL analysis
* Guix/Nix policy enforcement
* Instant-sync for forge propagation
* Jekyll GitHub Pages
* Mirror workflow
* Quality checks
* RSR antipattern detection
* Security scorecard
* Well-known file enforcement

=== Community & Governance
* `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` — Contributor Covenant 2.1 (template)
* `CONTRIBUTING.md` — Contribution guidelines (template)
* `SECURITY.md` — Security policy (template)
* Issue templates for bugs, features, docs, and questions

=== Documentation
* `docs/CITATIONS.adoc` — Citation formats (BibTeX, Harvard, OSCOLA, MLA, APA)

== Technology Stack
